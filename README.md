## A Pak File Creator


</div>

### Description

OK folks, I've made a little progress. Here is the latest. This one has problems with any files but text files. If you put the first file in the pak as an executable, it extracts fine. But 2nd 3rd and so on, no way. This code is driving me crazy!!! A big thanks to Robert Carter for his help on getting me this far. Please keep your ideas a coming folks. I know a lot of people out there can use this if it can ever get finished and fixed. There are still bugs in the code. I don't have many error handlers in it yet. I want to get the basics of the code fixed first, then I'll go back and make this thing proper.

This Code was fixed. Look for the AppenderPak by me. It is the same code as this but with fixes.
